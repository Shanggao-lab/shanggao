                    This paper proposes a model-free test for the strict stationarity of a potentially vector-valued time series using the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) approach. We show that the DFT of a residual process based on the empirical characteristic function weakly converges to a zero spectrum in the frequency domain for a strictly stationary time series and a nonzero spectrum otherwise. The proposed test is powerful against various types of nonstationarity including deterministic trends and smooth or abrupt structural changes. It does not require smoothed nonparametric estimation and, thus, can detect the Pitman sequence of local alternatives at the parametric rate T^{-1/2}, faster than all existing nonparametric tests. We also design a class of derivative tests based on the characteristic function to test the stationarity in various moments. Monte Carlo studies demonstrate that our test has reasonable size and excellent power. Our empirical application of exchange rates strongly suggests that both nominal and real exchange rate returns are nonstationary, which the augmented Dickey–Fuller and Kwiatkowski–Phillips–Schmidt–Shin tests may overlook.

                    This paper studies the estimation and variable selection in conditional factor models with high-dimensional instruments, where the coefficient matrix exhibits a low-rank and row-sparse structure. We propose a multi-stage estimation procedure that combines nuclear norm regularization and adaptive group LASSO regression to consistently estimate latent factors and row-sparse loading coefficients, while selecting relevant instrumental characteristics. We establish theoretical results for estimation consistency, selection consistency, and post-LASSO inference for estimators of factors and loading coefficients at multiple stages. Furthermore, we implement a singular value thresholding procedure to determine the number of factors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimators in consistently estimating factor loadings, selecting the appropriate number of factors, and conducting inference. Finally, we apply the proposed method to an empirical study on asset return prediction, showcasing its practical utility in real-world applications.

                    We introduce a state-varying factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR) model, wherein both factor loadings and FAVAR coefficients vary as general functions of a stochastic state process. We propose a two-stage estimation procedure that combines local principal component analysis with nonparametric kernel regressions to consistently estimate the model. We also establish a limiting distribution theory and the consistency of impulse response functions (IRFs) for the estimators of the state-varying FAVAR coefficients. To gauge potential sources of state-dependency features in the underlying FAVAR model, we propose three test statistics based on the discrete Fourier transform. Simulation results show the excellent performance of our estimators, IRF estimators, and test statistics in finite samples. We also apply the state-varying FAVAR model to examine the monetary policy transmission mechanism, using U.S. data. Our findings reveal that the IRFs of macroeconomic variables to a monetary policy shock are influenced by state variables, such as economic slackness and uncertainty indices.
